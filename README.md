This project has no purpose but for me to get my hands on c++ again for interviews and to show some capacity. It is to be later DELETED. It is really small since I did not spent much time on it but it covers various topics: c++, qt gui, qt event handling, multithreading, mysql co... 

It consists in a Qt application (GUI) in a thread interacting with another thread making some query to the mysql database.
It is supposed to look like the android mosalingua app.
The use of a mysql database in regards of the program make no sense.

This code contain some incoherence (i.e. in its structure), the lack of target and meaning as well as the used tool (c++) in this project is to explain some of them.
